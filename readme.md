#AVR Morsecode Interpreter
This tool allows a La Fortuna to be able to take in a analogue signal from one of the GPIO pins and then convert that to text. 
##Setup
On a La Fortuna connect a signal to the 0 pin of port D. 
###Ideas
This can be hooked up to a speaker so we you press the button you actually hear a sound. The use of the port pin can also be used to connect it to an audio jack where a computer code send a pre coded message.

##Variable speed
The Rotary encoder is used to configure the tempo of the morse code signal. This allows you to decide watch you think the appropriate beeping tempo is.

##Future Improvements
It would be cool to see if someone is able to attach To La Fortuna's together and have them communicate. Also, it might be conveniate if it could save the message to an SD card.
